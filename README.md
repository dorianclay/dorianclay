Iâ€™m an interdisciplinary person interested in making technology safe for humanity. I aim to derive technical solutions from a deep understanding of human systems and use those insights to design new technology systems. Right now, many of my interests fall into making sure AI is safe, robust, unbiased, trustworthy, and interpretable.

Here you'll find a variety of my projects, ranging from my work on AI to open source work to design projects.

Curious about my name? It's inspired by Asimov's [Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series) series. In naming things I also make a number of references to Orwell's [Nineteen Eighty-Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four) and its predecessor [We](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_%28novel%29) by Zamyatin.
